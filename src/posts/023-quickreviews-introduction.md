# [WIP] quickreviews: Introduction

A long time ago I started writing my own notes about new libraries and frameworks that are realesed to the world. Of couse, in the Javascript world this happens almost every second so we have to be critical on what is worth taking a look at.

The other focus of this articles are not just getting to know the names of the things we review.

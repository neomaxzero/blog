# [WIP] - quickreviews: [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes)

> version: 4.1.7

## What are you then?

a must have lazy load library for your images. It's so advanced is confusing. lazysizes provides with pretty much all the different variations on which you can trigger a lazy load of your application.

From the basic lazyload on scrolling to the low resolution image version.

## How does it work?

to start using the library you need to replace the `src` attribute on the imgs/iframe tags and append the class "lazyload". The library will take care of the rest.

the new src needs to be appended on a different tag called `data-src` which later will be placed on the regular `src` tag so the browser can request the resource.

```javascript
// this is assuming you already imported the library
<!-- non-responsive: -->
<img data-src="image.jpg" class="lazyload" />
```

The library is super extensive and let you defined automatic sizes depending on your viewport which is really handy to optimize network traffic.

## Now quickreview!

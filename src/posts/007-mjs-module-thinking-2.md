# [WIP] Let's review: Mastering Modular Javascript - Chapter 1 - 2/2.

Based on my [highlights](https://github.com/neomaxzero/m-quickreview/blob/master/mastering-modular-js/chapter-01.md)

It's been a while since the last time I write the review of the first part of the [chapter I](https://github.com/neomaxzero/m-quickreview/blob/master/mastering-modular-js/chapter-01.md). I've just read it, 10 mins ago and I can say **it sucks**. It does makes sense to me although. The idea is not to write about how I struggle to come up with digested content of the book, its to have something useful for me and hopefully for you.

So let's continue digging the second part of this chapter.

## The Perks of Modular Design

Modular design has its own pros and cons, but the book of course concentrate more on the goods because, well, you have to become a _master_ on it.

- When a module is small and decouple, a.k.a. modular, the ammount of code you have to see at each time decrease it.

  - Code is simpler.
  - Complex behaviour can still be represented by combining small modules.

- Manteanibility increase. (highly mantainable by default).
- Testing becomes way easier.
- If API first is always considered, adding complexity to the module becomes less of hard job.
- When adding a new use case to your module, always bare in mind that **flexibility always comes at the cost of added complexity**.

> Interfaces are always the primary citizen, and we get constant reminders of how important is to keep it minimal / sufficient / consistent.

The most important part of a module is its _Interface_ and it should be treat it like such.

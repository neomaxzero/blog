# A Rough start

Building a blog is easy? Maybe if you know nothing about programming you
can even use a blogging platorm such as Wordpress, blogspot, etc. The
chances are that you will pretty much be done in a couple of minutes with
a much more than enough tool to accomplish your goal and start focusing on
the content. The problem of being a _Software developer_ is that we tend
to overengineer most of the simple tasks we tackle just because we have
the ability to. Sometimes more often that we think about.

Now I'm being guilty of this same thought.I want to build a blog and
instead of going for a straight forward solution, I decided to dive into
the redicoulus task of reinventing the wheel, and also try a new
technology while doing this. Let me start again, building a blog is easy.

_Building a good, sublime, top notch quality content blog is *hard*. It's
extremely hard._

If focusing in the content was what we were talking about, let's also add
the fact that I want to have control of the platform. Well, I think the
subject got out of hands pretty easily.

Currently I'm basically coding the content, this is shitty, unscalable and
awful. I will investigate a little bit on how to pull content from
markdown and try to build a little more of a scalable architecture (again,
overengineering??). Will see.

This is my first blog post. The first "iteration". I constraint myself to
build a blog in less than 2 hours, now It's 93 min and I need to publish
this. Again, it looks awful I need to add an screenshot so we can
perpetrate this and check how much itchange in the future. When I decided
to do something most of the time, I decay in about 20 days, hopefully this
is not hte case for this blog, Wish me luck.

# Chaos as an exploration tool

Have you ever been in this situation where you don't know what had happened to the day and it's already gone? You have this feeling of under achievement because either you've planned a lot and that was the end of it or you have done everything on your list but still you don't have the fulfillment you expected.

I've been there. I was there yesterday, I might be there tomorrow.

I find _Chaos_ help me find joyment when I take decisions I find myself not commiting to.

I want to share some thoughts, random thoughts, you could even consider this _chaotic_, that's the whole point.

## chaos has a negative connotation

When you hear that someone is a chaotic person, you might immediately think negatively. I also thought like this the vast majority of my life because since my childhood, structure and order was one of the main values my family and institutions taught me.

When we hear about chaos, we tend to extrapolate to the extreme. That make it very easy for us to get the concept but this doesn't neccessarily need to be black and white.

Depending of the situation, extreme chaos can be something that adds value. If we take as an example a painting, there are many situations where we see the painter forget all the rules and go along with what we perceive as chaos and creates a master piece.

If we go to the other side of the spectrum and we are extremely organized, you could end up in a situation with some behavior that could lead to be so off, that it can be considered a TOC and harmful instead of supporting the situation it tries to remediate.

But, for some reason now this side of the spectrum is sociable accepted with more ease because of the misuse of the words and even brought to job interviews and other places you wouldn't have listened before.

The version of chaos I'm trying to convey here is closer to what we consider "Creativity".

Let me illustrate this with a small diagram where I show the "spectrum":

When everything we do, everything we decide, everything we say it's in line with what we plan we are on the "order" side of the range. If we plan, organize and act based on these premises outcomes are more deterministic and that helps on making future ideas a reality.

I want you to remember that to keep this scoped, I want to focus and use as an example the following topic: Technology and Frontend Engineering, which are the things I spend some time thinking and doing the last 5 years, by now.

## How chaos lead me to where I am now

When I was looking for my first job, I didn't know what I wanted to do (that doesn't mean I really know by now). My mindset at the time was:

> I need a job, I don't care about the technology, don't really care that much about the salary, I want to enter the job market.

After a few interviews, I got a `.NET developer` position as first dev job. I learnt A LOT in the process and I can assure you, **chaos was the main driver**. I can add reasoning behind most of the things that I did but it would be lying to my self If I said I got everything planned and I knew exactly that 5 years on I will be where I am today.

There was some UI development required for the job and that wasn't planned, I was inteded to do "backend" web services but literal chaos at work put me into the situation I needed to add some buttons to an old VB6 application, it was not easy, it was not hard, it was fun.

Another task came and it was in this case adding a button to one of the webapps we were maintaining. Again, not planned from my side but I enjoyed it a lot.

There was some small part of the design that was not decided, that part I had to think about how to display it. I'm a very visual person, and **I found a lot more joy** at doing this tasks than the SQL queries that i was doing it before.

A combination of many things, including chaos

## Deliberate chaos

vs uncontrolled

## How I think I should use chaos

## Conclusion

Don't feel that bad when you don't do everything that you said that you want to do.

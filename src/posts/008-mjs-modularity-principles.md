# [WIP] Let's review: Mastering Modular Javascript - Chapter 2 - 1/2.

Based on my [highlights](https://github.com/neomaxzero/m-quickreview/blob/master/mastering-modular-js/chapter-02.md)

***Disclaimer**
This chapter is a mix between my thoughts and my notes.
My notes are fully based on the text, so, if you want to check exactly what the author said please refer to the highlights.*

The second chapter talk about principles. Principles is an strong word. Independent of the context, principles are an inevitable consequence of something. In this case we can soften that saying that this will serve as a guideline to achieve "real" modularity.

## Modularity Principles

Why we want modularity was mostly answered in the previous chapter. If still, that is not clear enough. Modularity **can be the answer to complexity**. Unless you are a bad colleague you don't aim to increase the complexity of systems. In general, we want to add functionality to an existing system and the cost of that is an increase in complexity.

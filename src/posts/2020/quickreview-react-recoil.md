> [React-recoil](https://recoiljs.org/)

## What is it?

A state management library.

## Is it better than Redux?

I don't know. I don't think so. Redux is very verbose and it gives you a lot of control over the whole state update cycle. There are many cases where this could be exactly what you need.

## What is it good for?

Recoil API is very similar to the current React API. It is very performant because it solves the [issue](https://medium.com/@ryanflorence/react-context-and-re-renders-react-take-the-wheel-cd1d20663647) that React context can introduce to your code if you don't apply it correctly and you try to handle state yourself.

For small projects seems pretty nice. Also from what we can see in the video tutorial it covers a lot of use cases for big projects. (Memoization/Async)

## Can I use it everywhere?

Not really. It's still under development but you can start trying it out if you want.

## Are we all gonna use react-recoil in the end?

Of course not. It's going to be interesting indeed to see how mainstream this is gonna become among the react community.

## Conclusion

Need to experiment. Seems promising.

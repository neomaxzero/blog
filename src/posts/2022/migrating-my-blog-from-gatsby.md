I'm migrating from Gatsby. 

## Why?

I was going to change the way the blog look and in the process I realise I had a lot of outdated dependencies. I didn't want to deal with that now. In the process of coming out with reasons why it's a good idea to get out of gatsby are:

- Gatsby is not actually growing much.
- It's slow.
- This is just a blog.
- I rarely use Javascript.
- I don't need 1000s of dependencies.

## Why now?

I'm in a state of mind that I have the energy to migrate this blog to a new "stack". Also, It's fun and that's why I spend my time on this! I can add urgency to things that I feel are worth doing. 

Fun is always worth doing.

## Really?

Ok, maybe that is really really fun was a stretch. Do you wanna know what's coming? 

Stay tune...
